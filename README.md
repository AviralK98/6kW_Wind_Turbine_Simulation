# 6kW_Wind_Turbine_Simulation

This repository contains the 'modelforreview3.xls', which is the main Simulink (simulation) file where the whole project can be simulated by running it on MATLAB-Simulink. To understand the mechanism behind the 'modelforreview3.xls' file please go through the the 'ProjectReport.docx' and the 'finalPresentation' that are  comprehensive report and presentation containing the math, approach, output and future scope of the designed model. There is also a pdf of the published jounal that was based on the design and simulation of a 6kW wind turbine.
